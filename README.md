# Email signature

## Problem
I did not like the generated templates I found online so I decided to make my own and then I was introduced to the horrendous world of HTML Email design and its limitations. As it was put by Lee Munroe "[HTML email: Two words that, when combined, brings tears to a developerâ€™s eyes.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/introduction-building-sending-html-email-for-web-developers/)".

## How to steal this
it's as simple as downloading the [signature.html](signature.html) file and replacing the spots denoted with two brackets (eg: {Full name}) and then opening the file in a browser, selecting everything (Ctrl + A) and pasting it where signature should be.

(it's not stealing if you star :star: this repo).

## Future enhancements

* I'm open to making it more customisable (eg: adding other social media icons options) if other people seemed to need them, just open an issue or message me.
